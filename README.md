# Frontend-mentor-challenge. E-commerce landing-page.
This project is the challenge from Frontend-mentor. This is a single page application of e-commerce website. Layout is responsive on all devices, including responsive mobile navigation and a carousel slider.
Also in application you can find onscroll animations of different elements which are done using Intersection Observers API.

## Naming
Naming of classes is done using BEM naming convention. BEM is Block-Element-Modifier model, where blocks are supposed to be independent and reusable. Element of the block is marked with '__' (e.g. slider__image means that image is the element of the slider block). Modifiers are used to make elements more adaptive for special contexts.
Modifiers are made with '--' as a separate class (e.g. 'button button--footer', where button is the general class and --footer is modifier which adapts button for the footer context).
